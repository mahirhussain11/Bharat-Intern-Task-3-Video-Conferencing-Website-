# Bharat-Intern-Task-3-Video-Conferencing-Website-
Make ./ ngrok http 5500 run in the terminal 
             This will generate the web address which can be shared to friends and other colleagues so that they can 
             join the video call .
             Make sure You generate the token of agora and this web address whenever you  use this project .
             This token gives you the facility of video conferencing and mostly last for one day. So generate new token whenever you use this project.
 I will be readily happy if anyone visiting this repository will try this Video Conferencing website.
